# Laufire - JS Utils

  A simple set of utility libraries to ease development.

## Notes

* The reason for writing custom functions instead of depending on libraries is that, there isn't a coherent set. Depending on many libraries increases the time to learn their APIs.

## HowTo

* When immutability is required for functions like collection.merge and collection.combine, pass an empty base object. Ex: *merge({}, someObj)*

## ToDo

* *None, yet.*
